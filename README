Generate puzzles with Hodoku:

Download "hodoku.jar" from http://hodoku.sourceforge.net and
place it in the same folder as the python scripts.

Generate easy difficulty sudoku puzzles in a file called "Easy.txt"
in the currecnt directory. Press Ctrl-C when you want to stop.
java -jar hodoku.jar /s /sl 0

Generate medium difficulty sudoku puzzles in a file called "Medium.txt"
in the currecnt directory. Press Ctrl-C when you want to stop.
java -jar hodoku.jar /s /sl 1

Go to (http://hodoku.sourceforge.net/en/docs_ref.php#command_line)
for more info on Hodoku's command line arguements.



Convert puzzles to OpenSudoku format:

Convert "Easy.txt" to "Easy.opensudoku"
 (on linux)  ./easy-hodoku-to-opensudoku.py 
(on windows)  python3 easy-hodoku-to-opensudoku.py 

Convert "Medium.txt" to "Medium.opensudoku"
 (on linux)  ./medium-hodoku-to-opensudoku.py
(on windows)  python3 easy-hodoku-to-opensudoku.py 

Then open OpenSudoku and use the Import feature to import the generated puzzles into
the app.


It will be relatively simple to edit the scripts to change to hard or very hard puzzles.
It should be fairly basic to combine all this in to one master script, but this already 
does what I want it to do, so I may not work on it further.
